# AQUA-LIGHT* 
my first full project

Lighting for an aquarium with phase imitation of sunrise and sunset
This lighting should provide sufficient light for the aquarium. 3 watt LEDs are dimensioned so that the light is in the right spectrum for photosynthesis.
Another important task is to imitate the possibility of the "sunrise" and "sunset" phases in order to avoid stress for the fish.
